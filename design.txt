runner.py:
Takes in input from the console (log filename, user emails, user subscriptions) and runs and displays analysis.
analysis.py
Parses log file for errors and timestamps.

We chose to use dicts to store all of the data because it made it easy to access error-/email-specific counts and other data.

Rough outline of code execution:
1. runner takes in input filename and tries to open it
2. takes in input of email addresses and errors they are subscribed to
3. runs the parser to update counts of errors, timestamps, send emails (by printing to console)
4. prints summary of emails sent
5. prints number of unique errors, error frequencies, error timestamp frequencies
